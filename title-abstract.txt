Title:
Improving Performance of Vision Encoding Large Language Models with Contextual Prompts

Abstract:
Recent advancements in AI have led to the ability for large language models to understand data from different modalities. In this paper, we explain our methods to fine-tune LLaVA, an open-source Large Language and Visual Assistant similar to GPT-4, to read lung radiographs and generate a report in a given radiologistâ€™s style.
